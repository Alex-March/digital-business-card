This is one of my first react projects, the goal of which is to build a digital business card, based
on an alreadfy given Figma design, using React. The Figma design can be found using the following
link: https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card

To run the code, first make sure you have node and npm installed (can type in "node -v" and "npm-v"
into a command prompt and if they return a version, it means you have it installed)

Once you cloned the repo, make sure you're in the parent folder: cd react-info-site Make sure you
have the associated packages with the app: npm install To run the app: npm run dev

The command prompt should then provide a URL that you can enter into your browser, which should look
something like this: ➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/

And voilà! The app should be up and running.

Thank you for checking out my digital business card!
